# ResearchClaw — Autonomous Research Pipeline Skill

## Description

Run ResearchClaw's 23-stage autonomous research pipeline. Given a research topic, this skill orchestrates the entire research workflow: literature review → hypothesis generation → experiment design → code generation & execution → result analysis → paper writing → peer review → final export.

## Trigger Conditions

Activate this skill when the user:
- Asks to "research [topic]", "write a paper about [topic]", or "investigate [topic]"
- Wants to run an autonomous research pipeline
- Asks to generate a research paper from scratch
- Mentions "ResearchClaw" by name

## Instructions

### Workspace Handoff Rules

When resuming a paper workspace or cross-machine handoff:

1. Protect the current worktree first. Do not run `git pull`, `git reset`,
   cleanup commands, or untracked-directory deletion unless the user explicitly
   asks for it and the local status is understood.
2. Start by reading the handoff files, workspace README, release summary, and
   claim checklist before changing files.
3. Run the project release gate from the documented review/response kit. Treat
   `status=pass` as the handoff success condition, and report exact failing
   checks when it does not pass.
4. Do not output API keys, tokens, or private credentials. If a script reports
   missing Python packages, install only the packages required by the actual
   import error.
5. For manuscript PDFs, rebuild with a real TeX engine. Never use `touch` or
   timestamp edits to satisfy freshness checks, and do not weaken release gates
   just to pass.
6. For cross-platform evidence paths, map Windows, `/work`, or `/workspace`
   provenance paths to the current workspace only when the underlying artifact
   exists and hashes/manifests still validate. Do not promote evidence or
   claims beyond the current checklist boundaries.
7. When a release gate hard-codes stale packet counts or OS-specific path
   assumptions, fix the gate to derive expectations from the packet builder or
   validated metadata rather than relaxing substantive checks.

### Prerequisites Check

1. Verify config file exists:
   ```bash
   ls config.yaml || ls config.researchclaw.example.yaml
   ```
2. If no `config.yaml`, create one from the example:
   ```bash
   cp config.researchclaw.example.yaml config.yaml
   ```
3. Ensure the user's LLM API key is configured in `config.yaml` under `llm.api_key` or via `llm.api_key_env` environment variable.

### Running the Pipeline

**Option A: CLI (recommended)**

```bash
researchclaw run --topic "Your research topic here" --auto-approve
```

Options:
- `--topic` / `-t`: Override the research topic from config
- `--config` / `-c`: Config file path (default: `config.yaml`)
- `--output` / `-o`: Output directory (default: `artifacts/rc-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-HASH/`)
- `--from-stage`: Resume from a specific stage (e.g., `PAPER_OUTLINE`)
- `--auto-approve`: Auto-approve gate stages (5, 9, 20) without human input

**Option B: Python API**

```python
from researchclaw.pipeline.runner import execute_pipeline
from researchclaw.config import RCConfig
from researchclaw.adapters import AdapterBundle
from pathlib import Path

config = RCConfig.load("config.yaml", check_paths=False)
results = execute_pipeline(
    run_dir=Path("artifacts/my-run"),
    run_id="research-001",
    config=config,
    adapters=AdapterBundle(),
    auto_approve_gates=True,
)

# Check results
for r in results:
    print(f"Stage {r.stage.name}: {r.status.value}")
```

**Option C: Iterative Pipeline (multi-round improvement)**

```python
from researchclaw.pipeline.runner import execute_iterative_pipeline

results = execute_iterative_pipeline(
    run_dir=Path("artifacts/my-run"),
    run_id="research-001",
    config=config,
    adapters=AdapterBundle(),
    max_iterations=3,
    convergence_rounds=2,
)
```

### Output Structure

After a successful run, the output directory contains:

```
artifacts/<run-id>/
├── stage-1/                # TOPIC_INIT outputs
├── stage-2/                # PROBLEM_DECOMPOSE outputs
├── ...
├── stage-10/
│   └── experiment.py       # Generated experiment code
├── stage-12/
│   └── runs/run-1.json     # Experiment execution results
├── stage-14/
│   ├── experiment_summary.json  # Aggregated metrics
│   └── results_table.tex        # LaTeX results table
├── stage-17/
│   └── paper_draft.md      # Full paper draft
├── stage-22/
│   └── charts/             # Generated visualizations
│       ├── metric_trajectory.png
│       └── experiment_comparison.png
└── pipeline_summary.json   # Overall pipeline status
```

### Experiment Modes

| Mode | Description | Config |
|------|-------------|--------|
| `simulated` | LLM generates synthetic results (no code execution) | `experiment.mode: simulated` |
| `sandbox` | Execute generated code locally via subprocess | `experiment.mode: sandbox` |
| `ssh_remote` | Execute on remote GPU server via SSH | `experiment.mode: ssh_remote` |

### Troubleshooting

- **Config validation error**: Run `researchclaw validate --config config.yaml`
- **LLM connection failure**: Check `llm.base_url` and API key
- **Sandbox execution failure**: Verify `experiment.sandbox.python_path` exists and has numpy installed
- **Gate rejection**: Use `--auto-approve` or manually approve at stages 5, 9, 20

## Tools Required

- File read/write (for config and artifacts)
- Bash (for CLI execution)
- No external MCP servers required for basic operation
